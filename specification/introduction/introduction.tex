\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

UAVCAN is a lightweight protocol designed to provide a highly reliable communication method for
aerospace and robotic applications via robust vehicle bus networks.

This is a non-normative chapter covering the basic concepts that govern development and maintenance of
the specification.

\section{Document conventions}

Non-normative text, examples, recommendations, and elaborations that do not directly participate
in the definition of the protocol are contained in footnotes\footnote{This is a footnote.}
or highlighted sections as shown below.

\begin{remark}
    Non-normative sections such as examples are enclosed in shaded boxes like this.
\end{remark}

Code listings are formatted as shown below.
All such code is distributed under the same license as this specification, unless specifically stated otherwise.

It is assumed that a byte always contains eight bits.

\section{Design principles}

\begin{description}
    \item[Democratic network] --- There will be no master node.
    All nodes in the network will have the same communication rights; there must be no single point of failure.

    \item[Facilitation of functional safety] --- A system designer relying on UAVCAN will have the necessary
    guarantees and tools at their disposal to analyze the system and ensure its correct behavior.

    \item[High-level communication abstractions] --- The protocol will support publish/subscribe and remote procedure
    call communication semantics with statically defined and statically verified data types (schema).
    The data types used for communication will be defined in a clear, platform-agnostic way
    that can be easily understood by machines, including humans.

    \item[Facilitation of cross-vendor interoperability] --- UAVCAN will be a common foundation that
    different vendors can build upon to maximize interoperability of their equipment.
    UAVCAN will provide a generic set of standard application-agnostic communication data types.

    \item[Well-defined generic high-level functions] --- UAVCAN will define standard services
    and messages for common high-level functions, such as network discovery, node configuration,
    node software update, node status monitoring\footnote{Which naturally grows into a vehicle-wide
    health monitoring solution.}, network-wide time synchronization, plug-and-play node support, etc.

    \item[Atomic data abstractions] --- Nodes must be provided with a simple way of exchanging large
    data structures that exceed the capacity of a single transport frame\footnote{A \emph{transport frame} is
    an atomic transmission unit defined by the underlying transport protocol. For example, a CAN frame.}.
    UAVCAN should perform automatic data decomposition and reassembly at the protocol level,
    hiding the related complexity from the application.

    \item[High throughput, low latency, determinism] --- UAVCAN will add a very low overhead to the underlying
    transport protocol, which will ensure high throughput and low latency, rendering the protocol well-suited
    for hard real-time applications.

    \item[Support for redundant interfaces and redundant nodes] --- UAVCAN must be suitable for use in
    applications that require modular redundancy.

    \item[Simple logic, low computational requirements] --- UAVCAN targets a wide variety of embedded systems,
    from high-performance on-board computers to extremely resource-constrained microcontrollers.
    It will be inexpensive to support in terms of computing power and engineering hours,
    and advanced features can be implemented incrementally as needed.

    \item[Support for various transport protocols] --- UAVCAN will be usable with different transports.
    The standard must be capable of accommodating other transport protocols in the future.

    \item[Open specification and reference implementations] --- The UAVCAN specification will always be open and
    free to use for everyone; the reference implementations will be distributed under the terms of
    the permissive MIT License or released into the public domain.
\end{description}

\section{Capabilities}

UAVCAN-based networks can accommodate up to 128 nodes on the same logical bus.

UAVCAN supports an unlimited number of data types, which can be defined by the specification (such definitions
are called ``standard data types'') or by others for private use or for public release
(in which case they are said to be ``application-specific'' or ``vendor-specific'').
There can be up to 256 major versions of a data type, and up to 256 minor versions per major version.
More information is provided in chapter \ref{sec:dsdl}.

UAVCAN supports 65536 message subject identifiers for publish/subscribe exchanges,
512 service identifiers for remote procedure call exchanges,
and at least 8 anonymous message subject identifiers for certain special features such as plug-and-play support.
A small subset of these identifiers is reserved for the core standard and for publicly released vendor-specific types.
More information is provided in chapter \ref{sec:application_layer}.

UAVCAN supports at least\footnote{Depending on the transport protocol.} eight distinct communication priority levels,
defined in section \ref{sec:transfer_prioritization}.
Within each priority level different types of transfers, messages, and services are
prioritized in a well-defined, deterministic manner.

The list of transport protocols supported by UAVCAN is provided in chapter \ref{sec:transport_layer}.
Non-redundant, doubly-redundant and triply-redundant transports are supported.
More information on the physical layer and standardized physical connectivity options
is provided in chapter \ref{sec:physical_layer}.

\section{Maintenance of the standard data type set}

The UAVCAN maintainers are charged with advancing the standard data type set based on input from adopters.
This feedback is gathered via the official discussion
forum\footnote{Please refer to \href{http://uavcan.org}{uavcan.org}.}
which is open to the general public.

The set of standard data type definitions\footnote{The \emph{data structure description language} (DSDL) and
related concepts are described in section \ref{sec:dsdl}.} is an integral part of the specification;
however, there is only a small set of required data types needed to implement the protocol.
A larger set of optional data types are defined to create a standardized data exchange environment
supporting the interoperability of COTS\footnote{Commercial off-the-shelf equipment.}
equipment manufactured by different vendors.
See chapter \ref{sec:application_layer} for more information.

Within the same major version of the specification,
the set of regulated data type definitions can be modified only in the following ways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A new data type can be added, as long as it doesn't conflict with any of the existing data types.

    \item An existing data type can be modified, as long as its version number is updated accordingly
    and all backward compatibility guarantees are respected.

    \item An existing data type or a particular major version of it can be declared deprecated.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Once declared deprecated, the data type will be maintained for at least two more years.
        After this period, its regulated port ID (if defined) may be reused for an incompatible data type definition.
        The maintainers will be striving to postpone the reuse of regulated port identifiers as much as
        possible in order to minimize the possibility of unintended conflicts.

        \item Deprecation will be indicated in the DSDL definition and announced via the discussion forum.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

A link to the repository containing the set of default DSDL definitions can be found on the official
website\footnote{\href{http://uavcan.org}{uavcan.org}}.
