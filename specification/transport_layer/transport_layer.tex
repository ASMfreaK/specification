\chapter{Transport layer}\label{sec:transport_layer}

This chapter defines the transport layer of UAVCAN.
First, general implementation-agnostic concepts are introduced.
Afterwards, they are further defined for each supported transport medium, e.g., CAN FD.

\section{The concept of transfer}

A \emph{transfer} is an act of data transmission between nodes.
A transfer that is addressed to all nodes except the source node is a \emph{broadcast transfer}.
A transfer that is addressed to one particular node is a \emph{unicast transfer}.
UAVCAN defines the following types of transfers:

\begin{description}
    \item[Message transfer] - a broadcast transfer that contains a serialized message.
    \item[Service transfer] - a unicast transfer that contains either a service request or a service response.
\end{description}

Both message and service transfers can be further distinguished between:

\begin{description}
    \item[Single-frame transfer] - a transfer that is entirely contained in a single transport frame.
    The amount of data that can be exchanged using single-frame transfers is dependent on the transport protocol in use.

    \item[Multi-frame transfer] - a transfer that has its payload distributed over multiple transport frames.
    The UAVCAN protocol stack handles transfer decomposition and reassembly automatically.
\end{description}

The following properties are common to all types of transfers:

\begin{UAVCANSimpleTable}{Common transfer properties}{|l X|}\label{table:common_transfer_properties}
    Property        & Description \\
    Payload         & The serialized data structure. \\
    Data type ID    & A numerical identifier that indicates how the data structure should be interpreted. \\
    Data type major version number & Semantic major version number of the data type definition. \\
    Source node ID  & The node ID of the transmitting node (excepting anonymous message transfers). \\
    Priority        & A non-negative integer value that defines the transfer urgency.
                      Higher priority transfers can preempt lower priority transfers. \\
    Transfer ID     & A small overflowing integer that increments with every transfer
                      of this data type from a given node. \\
\end{UAVCANSimpleTable}

\subsection{Message broadcasting}

Message broadcasting is the main method of communication between UAVCAN nodes.

A broadcast message is carried by a single message transfer that contains the serialized message data structure.
A broadcast message does not contain any additional fields besides those listed in the table
\ref{table:common_transfer_properties}.

In order to broadcast a message, the broadcasting node must have a node ID that is unique within the network.
An exception applies to \emph{anonymous message broadcasts}.

\subsubsection{Anonymous message broadcasting}

An anonymous message transfer is a transfer that can be sent from a node that does not have a node ID.
This sort of message transfer is especially useful for \emph{dynamic node ID allocation}
(a high-level concept that is reviewed in detail in the chapter \ref{sec:application_layer}).

A node that does not have a node ID is said to be in \emph{passive mode}.
Passive nodes are unable to initiate regular data exchanges,
but they can listen to the data exchanged over the bus,
and they can emit anonymous message transfers.

An anonymous message has the same properties as a regular message, except for the source node ID,
which in the case of anonymous message transfers is always assumed to be zero.

An anonymous transfer can only be a single-frame transfer. Multi-frame anonymous message transfers are not allowed.
This restriction must be kept in mind when designing message data types
intended for use with anonymous message transfers:
when used with anonymous transfers, the whole message must fit into a single transport frame;
however, the same data type can be used with multi-frame regular (non-anonymous) transfers.

The set of message type ID values that can be used with anonymous messages may be limited
depending on the transport in use
(section \ref{sec:transport_layer})\footnote{This is considered to be an acceptable limitation because
anonymous transfers are intended for an extremely limited set of use cases.}.
It is guaranteed, however, that the message data type ID in the range from 0 to 7, inclusively,
are always available for use with anonymous messages regardless of the transport in use.

Note that anonymous messages require specific arbitration rules and have restrictions on the acceptable
data type ID values. The details are explained later in this chapter.

\subsubsection{Message timing requirements}

Generally, a message transmission should be aborted if it cannot be completed in 1 second.
Applications are allowed to deviate from this recommendation,
provided that every such deviation is explicitly documented.
It is expected that high-frequency high-priority messages may opt for lower timeout values,
whereas low-priority data may opt for higher timeout values to account for the network congestion.

\subsection{Service invocation}

A service invocation sequence consists of two related service transfers:

\begin{description}
    \item[Service request transfer] - from the node that invokes the service - the \emph{client} - to the node that
    provides the service - the \emph{server}.

    \item[Service response transfer] - once the \emph{server node} receives the service request and processes it,
    it sends a response transfer back to the \emph{client node}.
\end{description}

The tables \ref{table:service_request_transfer_properties} and \ref{table:service_response_transfer_properties}
describe the properties of service request and service response transfers, respectively.

Both the client and the server must have node ID values that are unique within the network;
service invocation is not available to passive nodes.

\begin{UAVCANSimpleTable}{Service request transfer properties}{|l X|}\label{table:service_request_transfer_properties}
    Property                        & Description \\
    Payload                         & The serialized service request data structure. \\
    Data type ID                    & See the table \ref{table:common_transfer_properties}. \\
    Data type major version number  & See the table \ref{table:common_transfer_properties}. \\
    Source node ID                  & The node ID of the client (the invoking node). \\
    Destination node ID             & The node ID of the server (the invoked node). \\
    Priority                        & See the table \ref{table:common_transfer_properties}. \\
    Transfer ID                     & An integer value that:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item allows the server to distinguish the request from other requests from the same client;
            \item allows the client to match the response with its request.
        \end{enumerate} \\
\end{UAVCANSimpleTable}

\begin{UAVCANSimpleTable}{Service response transfer properties}{|l X|}\label{table:service_response_transfer_properties}
    Property                        & Description \\
    Payload                         & The serialized service response data structure. \\
    Data type ID                    & Same value as in the request transfer. \\
    Data type major version number  & Same value as in the request transfer. \\
    Source node ID                  & The node ID of the server (the invoked node). \\
    Destination node ID             & The node ID of the client (the invoking node). \\
    Priority                        & Same value as in the request transfer. \\
    Transfer ID                     & Same value as in the request transfer. \\
\end{UAVCANSimpleTable}

\subsubsection{Service timing requirements}

Applications should follow the service invocation timing recommendations specified below.
Applications are allowed to deviate from these recommendations,
provided that every such deviation is explicitly documented.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Service transfer transmission should be aborted if does not complete in 1 second.
    \item The client should stop waiting for a response from the server if one has not arrived within 1 second.
\end{itemize}

If the server uses a significant part of the timeout period to process the request,
the client might drop the request before receiving the response.
It is recommended to ensure that the server will be able to process any request in less than 0.5 seconds.

\subsection{Transfer prioritization}\label{sec:transfer_prioritization}

UAVCAN transfers are prioritized by means of the transfer priority property,
which allows at least eight different priority levels for all types of transfers.
The priority level mnemonics are specified in the following list.
The mapping between the mnemonics and actual numeric identifiers is transport-dependent.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Foreground (highest)
    \item Super
    \item Urgent
    \item High
    \item Normal
    \item Low
    \item Diagnostic
    \item Background (lowest)
\end{itemize}

Transfers with higher priority levels preempt transfers with lower priority levels,
delaying their transmission until there are no more higher priority transfers to exchange.

\section{Transfer emission}

\subsection{Transfer ID computation}\label{sec:transfer_id}\label{sec:transfer_descriptor}

The \emph{transfer ID} is a small unsigned integer value in the range from 0 to 31, inclusive,
that is provided for every transfer.
This value is crucial for many aspects of UAVCAN communication\footnote{One might be tempted to use the transfer ID
value for temporal synchronization of parallel message streams originating from the same node,
where messages bearing the same transfer ID value are supposed to correspond to the same moment of time.
Such use is strongly discouraged because it is impossible to detect if one node is more than
32 messages behind another.
If temporal synchronization is necessary, explicit time stamping should be used instead.};
specifically:
\begin{description}
    \item[Message sequence monitoring] - the continuously increasing transfer ID allows receiving nodes to
    detect lost messages and detect when a message stream from any remote node is interrupted.

    \item[Service response matching] - when a server responds to a request, it uses the same transfer ID for the
    response as in the request,
    allowing any node to emit concurrent requests to the same server while being able to
    match each response with the corresponding request.

    \item[Transport frame deduplication] - for single-frame transfers,
    the transfer ID allows receiving nodes to work around the transport
    frame duplication problem\footnote{This is a well-known issue that can be observed with certain
    transports such as CAN bus -- a frame that appears valid to the receiver may under certain
    (rare) conditions appear invalid to the transmitter, triggering the latter to retransmit the frame,
    in which case it will be duplicated on the side of the receiver.
    Sequence counting mechanisms such as the transfer ID or the toggle bit (both of which are used in UAVCAN)
    allow applications to circumvent this problem.} (multi-frame transfers combat the frame duplication
    problem using the toggle bit).

    \item[Multi-frame transfer reassembly] - more info is provided in the section \ref{sec:transfer_reception}.

    \item[Automatic management of redundant interfaces] - the transfer ID parameter allows the UAVCAN protocol
    stack to perform automatic switchover to a back-up interface shall the primary interface fail.
    The switchover logic can be completely transparent to the application, joining several independent
    redundant physical transports into a highly reliable single virtual communication channel.
\end{description}

For message transfers and service request transfers the ID value should be computed as described below.
For service response transfers this value must be directly copied from the corresponding service request transfer.

The logic to compute the transfer ID relies on the concept of \emph{transfer descriptor}.
A transfer descriptor is a set of properties that identify a particular set of transfers that originate
from the same node, share the same data type ID, same data type major version number, and the same type.
The properties that constitute a transfer descriptor are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transfer type (message broadcast, service request, etc.).
    \item Data type ID.
    \item Data type major version number.
    \item Source node ID.
    \item Destination node ID (only for unicast\footnote{I.e., service requests and service responses.} transfers).
\end{itemize}

Every non-passive node must maintain a mapping from transfer descriptors to transfer ID counters.
This mapping is referred to as the \emph{transfer ID map}.

Whenever a node needs to emit a transfer, it will query its transfer ID map for the appropriate transfer descriptor.
If the map does not contain such entry, a new entry will be created with the transfer ID counter initialized to zero.
The node will use the current value of the transfer ID from the map for the transfer,
and then the value stored in the map will be incremented by one.
When the stored transfer ID exceeds its maximum value, it will roll over to zero.

It is expected that some nodes will need to publish certain transfers aperiodically or on an ad-hoc basis,
thereby creating unused entries in the transfer ID map.
In order to avoid keeping unused entries in the map, the nodes are allowed, but not required,
to remove entries from the map that were not used for more than 2 seconds.
Therefore, it is possible that a node may publish a transfer with an out-of-order transfer ID value,
if the previous transfer of the same descriptor has been published more than 2 seconds earlier.

\subsection{Single frame transfers}

If the size of the entire transfer payload does not exceed the space available for payload in a single transport frame,
the whole transfer will be contained in one transport frame.
Such transfer is called a \emph{single-frame transfer}.

Single frame transfers are more efficient than multi-frame transfers in terms of throughput, latency,
and data overhead.

\subsection{Multi-frame transfers}

\emph{Multi-frame transfers} are used when the size of the transfer payload exceeds the space available
for payload in a single transport frame.

Two new concepts are introduced in the context of multi-frame transfers, both of which are reviewed below in detail:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Transfer CRC\footnote{CRC stands for "cyclic redundancy check", an error-detecting code
    added to data transmissions to reduce the likelihood of undetected data corruption.}.
    \item Toggle bit.
\end{itemize}

In order to emit a multi-frame transfer, the node must first compute the CRC for the entirety of the transfer payload.
The node appends the CRC value at the end of the transfer payload,
and then emits the resulting byte set in chunks as an ordered sequence of transport frames
(i.e. the last transport frame contains the last bytes of the payload and the transfer CRC).
The data field of all transport frames of a multi-frame transfer, except the last one, must be fully utilized.

All frames of a multi-frame transfer should be pushed to the transmission queue at once,
in the proper order from the first frame to the last frame.
Explicit gap time between transport frames belonging to the same transfer should not be introduced.

\subsubsection{Transfer CRC}\label{sec:transfer_crc}

The objective of the transfer CRC is to allow receiving nodes to validate correctness of
multi-frame transfer reassembly.
It should be understood that the transfer CRC is not intended for bit-level data integrity checks,
as that must be managed by the transport layer implementation on a per-frame basis.
As such, the transfer CRC allows receiving nodes to ensure that all of the frames of a multi-frame
transfer were received, all of the received frames were reassembled in the correct order,
and that all of the received frames belong to the same multi-frame transfer.

The transfer CRC is computed over the entire payload of the transfer.
Certain transport implementations, such as CAN FD, may require a short sequence of padding bytes to be added
at the end of the transfer payload due to low granularity of the frame payload length property;
in that case, the padding bytes are not to be included in the CRC computation.

The resulting CRC value is appended to the transfer in the \emph{big-endian byte order}
(most significant byte first),
in order to take advantage of the CRC residue check intrinsic to this algorithm.

The transfer CRC algorithm specification is provided in the table \ref{table:transfer_crc_params}.

\begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth}
\begin{UAVCANSimpleTable}{Transfer CRC algorithm parameters}{|ll|}\label{table:transfer_crc_params}
    Property        & Value \\
    Name            & CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE \\
    Initial value   & \texttt{0xFFFF} \\
    Polynomial      & \texttt{0x1021} \\
    Reverse         & No \\
    Output XOR      & $0$ \\
    Residue         & $0$ \\

\end{UAVCANSimpleTable}
\end{minipage}

The following code snippet provides an implementation of the transfer CRC algorithm in C++.

\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}
\begin{minted}{cpp}

public:
    void add(std::uint8_t byte)
    {
        value_ ^= static_cast<std::uint16_t>(byte) << 8U;
        for (std::uint8_t bit = 8; bit > 0; --bit)
        {
            if ((value_ & 0x8000U) != 0)
            {
                value_ = (value_ << 1U) ^ 0x1021U;
            }
            else
            {

        }
    }

    void add(const std::uint8_t* bytes, std::size_t length)
    {
        while (length-- > 0)
        {
            add(*bytes++);
        }
    }

    [[nodiscard]] std::uint16_t get() const { return value_; }
};

int main()
{
    TransferCRC crc;
    crc.add(reinterpret_cast<const std::uint8_t*>("123456789"), 9);
    std::cout << std::hex << "0x" << crc.get() << std::endl;  // Outputs 0x29B1
    return 0;
}
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Toggle bit}\label{sec:toggle_bit}

The toggle bit is a property defined at the transport frame level.
Its purpose is to detect and avoid transport frame duplication errors in multi-frame
transfers\footnote{In single-frame transfers, transport frame deduplication is based on the transfer ID counter.}.

The toggle bit of the first transport frame of a multi-frame transfer must be set to one.
The toggle bits of the following transport frames of the transfer must alternate,
i.e., the toggle bit of the second transport frame must be zero,
the toggle bit of the third transport frame must be one, and so on.

For single-frame transfers, the toggle bit must be set to one or removed completely,
whichever option works best for the particular transport.

Transfers where the initial value of the toggle bit is zero must be ignored.
The initial state of the toggle bit may be inverted in the future revisions of the protocol
to facilitate automatic protocol version detection.

\subsection{Redundant interface support}

In configurations with redundant bus interfaces,
nodes are required to submit every outgoing transfer to the transmission queues of
all available redundant interfaces simultaneously.
It is recognized that perfectly simultaneous transmission may not be possible due to different
utilization rates of the redundant interfaces and different phasing of their traffic;
however, that is not an issue for UAVCAN.
If perfectly simultaneous frame submission is not possible, interfaces with lower numerical index
should be handled in the first order.

An exception to the above rule applies if the payload of the transfer depends on some properties
of the interface through which the transfer is emitted.
An example of such a special case is the time synchronization algorithm leveraged by UAVCAN
(documented in the chapter \ref{sec:application_layer} of the specification).

Redundant interfaces are used for increased fault tolerance, not for load sharing reasons.
Whenever a node is connected to an interface the likelihood of the interface failing is increased.
This suggests that backup interfaces may only interconnect with mission-critical equipment.
See section \ref{sec:phy_non_uniform_transport_redundancy}.

\section{Transfer reception}\label{sec:transfer_reception}

\subsection{Transfer ID comparison}

The following explanation relies on the concept of the \emph{transfer ID forward distance}.
Transfer ID forward distance $F$ is a function of two transfer ID values,
$A$ and $B$, that defines the number of increment operations that need to be applied to
$A$ so that $A^\prime{} = B$, assuming modulo 32 arithmetic:
$$A + F = B \quad (\bmod{}\ 32)$$
Consider the examples provided in the table \ref{table:transfer_id_fwd_dst_ex}.

The \emph{half range} of transfer ID is 16.

\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
\begin{UAVCANSimpleTable}{Transfer ID forward distance examples}{|X[c] X[c]|X[c]|}
    $A$ & $B$   & $F$ \label{table:transfer_id_fwd_dst_ex} \\
    0   & 0     & 0 \\
    0   & 5     & 5 \\
    5   & 0     & 27 \\
    31  & 30    & 31 \\
    31  & 0     & 1 \\
\end{UAVCANSimpleTable}
\end{minipage}

The following code sample provides an example implementation of the transfer ID comparison algorithm in C++.

\begin{minipage}{0.9\textwidth}  % Mini page is needed to prevent page breaks within the snippet
\begin{minted}{cpp}
// UAVCAN transfer ID forward distance computation algorithm implemented in C++.

#include <cstdint>

constexpr std::uint8_t TransferIDBitLength = 5;

[[nodiscard]]
constexpr std::uint8_t computeForwardDistance(std::uint8_t a, std::uint8_t b)
{
    constexpr std::uint8_t MaxValue = (1U << TransferIDBitLength) - 1U;
    assert((a <= MaxValue) && (b <= MaxValue));

    std::int16_t d = static_cast<std::int16_t>(b) - static_cast<std::int16_t>(a);
    if (d < 0)
    {
        d += 1U << TransferIDBitLength;
    }

    assert(d >= 0);
    assert(d <= MaxValue);
    assert(((a + d) & MaxValue) == b);
    return static_cast<std::uint8_t>(d);
}

{
    assert(0  == computeForwardDistance(0, 0));
    assert(1  == computeForwardDistance(0, 1));
    assert(7  == computeForwardDistance(0, 7));
    assert(0  == computeForwardDistance(7, 7));
    assert(31 == computeForwardDistance(31, 30)); // overflow
    assert(1  == computeForwardDistance(31, 0));  // overflow
    return 0;
}
\end{minted}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{State variables}

Nodes that receive transfers must keep a certain set of state variables for each
transfer descriptor\footnote{The concept of \emph{transfer descriptor} is explained
in the section \ref{sec:transfer_descriptor}.}.
The set of state variables will be referred to as the \emph{receiver state}.
For the purposes of this specification, it is assumed that the node will maintain a
mapping from transfer descriptors to receiver states, which will be referred to as the \emph{receiver map}.
It is understood, however, that real implementations may resort to different architectures as
long as the resulting behavior of the node observable at the protocol level is functionally equivalent.

The list of receiver state variables is provided in the table \ref{table:transfer_receiver_state_variables}.
Operations defined on receiver states are listed in the table
\ref{table:transfer_receiver_state_operations};
and the set of conditions defined for receiver states is provided in the table
\ref{table:transfer_receiver_state_conditions}.

Whenever a node receives a transfer, it will query its receiver map for the matching transfer descriptor.
If the matching state does not exist, the node will add a new uninitialized receiver state to the map.
The node then will proceed with the procedure of \emph{receiver state update}, which is defined below in this section.

It is expected that some transfers will be aperiodic or ad-hoc,
which implies that the receiver map may over time accumulate receiver states that are no longer used.
Therefore, nodes are allowed, but not required, to remove any receiver state from the receiver map,
once the state reaches the \emph{transfer ID timeout condition}.

Receiver state can only be modified when a new transport frame of a matching transfer is received.
This guarantee simplifies implementation, as it implies that the receiver states will not
require any background maintenance processes.

\begin{UAVCANSimpleTable}{Transfer reception state variables}{|l X|}
    State               & Description \label{table:transfer_receiver_state_variables} \\

                          Here, "monotonic" means that the reference clock does not change its rate or leap. \\
    Interface index     & Only in the case of redundant transport interfaces. \\
\end{UAVCANSimpleTable}

\begin{UAVCANSimpleTable}{Transfer reception state operations}{|l X|}
    Operation   & Description \label{table:transfer_receiver_state_operations} \\

    Extension   & Add newly received useful payload data to the current transfer payload state. \\

    Restart     & Reset the state variables to match the parameters of a new transfer.
                  A reset can only be performed synchronously with the reception of a matching transport frame
                  which is the first frame of a new transfer (e.g. the start of transfer flag is set).
                  A reset operation includes at least the following:
                  \begin{itemize}
                      \item Clearing (emptying) the transfer payload state.
                      \item Updating the transfer ID state with the actual transfer ID value from the new transfer.
                      \item Setting the toggle bit to its initial state (section \ref{sec:toggle_bit}).
                      \item Initializing the transfer timestamp with the reception timestamp from the transport frame.
                      \item Initializing the interface index (for nodes with redundant interfaces only).
                  \end{itemize}\\
\end{UAVCANSimpleTable}

\begin{UAVCANSimpleTable}{Transfer reception state conditions}{|l X|}
    Condition       & Description \label{table:transfer_receiver_state_conditions} \\

    Uninitialized   &
    The default condition, which indicates that the receiver state has not yet seen any transfers. \\

    Transfer ID timeout &
    Last matching transfer was seen more than 2 seconds ago.\\

    Interface switch allowed &
    This condition is only applicable for configurations with redundant transport interfaces.
    It means that the node is allowed to receive the next transfer from an interface that is not the same
    the previous transfer was received from.
    The condition is reached when the last matching transfer has been successfully received more than
    $T_\text{switch}$ seconds ago. The value of $T_\text{switch}$ must not exceed 2 seconds.
    The actual value of $T_\text{switch}$ can be either a constant chosen by the designer according
    to the application requirements (e.g., maximum recovery time in the event of an interface failure),
    or the protocol stack can estimate this value automatically by analyzing the transfer intervals. \\
\end{UAVCANSimpleTable}

Nodes are required to let the first interface time out before using the next one because the
transfer ID field is expected to wrap around frequently (every 32 transfers).
Different interfaces are expected to exhibit different latencies even in a properly functioning system,
especially if the system contains both redundantly-interfaced and non-redundantly-interfaced nodes.
If the latency of a backup interface relative to the primary interface exceeds 32 transfer intervals,
and receiving nodes were to be allowed to switch between interfaces freely disregarding the timeout,
the receiving node would skip the whole period of transfer IDs (32 transfers will be lost).
The problem would primarily affect low-priority transfers where large latencies are possible.

\subsection{State update in a redundant interface configuration}

The following pseudocode demonstrates the transfer reception process
for a configuration with redundant transport interfaces.

\subsection{State update in a non-redundant interface configuration}

The following pseudocode demonstrates the transfer reception process for a configuration
with a non-redundant transport interface.
This is a specialization of the more general algorithm defined for redundant transport.

\begin{minted}{cpp}
// Constants:
tid_timeout := 2 seconds;

// State variables:
initialized := 0;
payload;
this_transfer_timestamp;
current_transfer_id;
toggle;

{
    // Resolving the state flags:
    tid_timed_out := (frame.timestamp - this_transfer_timestamp) > tid_timeout;
    first_frame := frame.start_of_transfer;
    not_previous_tid := computeForwardDistance(frame.transfer_id, current_transfer_id) > 1;

    // Using the state flags from above, deciding whether we need to reset:
    need_restart :=
        (!initialized) or
        (tid_timed_out) or
        (first_frame and not_previous_tid);

    if (need_restart)
    {
        initialized := 1;
        current_transfer_id := frame.transfer_id;
        payload.clear();
        toggle := 0;
        if (!first_frame)
        {
            current_transfer_id.increment();
            return; // Ignore this frame, since the start of the transfer has already been missed
        }
    }

    if (frame.toggle != toggle)
    {
        return;  // Unexpected toggle bit, ignore
    }

    if (frame.transfer_id != current_transfer_id)
    {
        return;  // Unexpected transfer ID, ignore
    }

    if (first_frame)
    {
        this_transfer_timestamp := frame.timestamp;
    }

    toggle := !toggle;
    payload.append(frame.data);

    if (frame.last_frame)
    {
        // CRC validation for multi-frame transfers is intentionally omitted for brevity
        processTransfer(payload, ...);

        current_transfer_id.increment();
        toggle := 0;
        payload.clear();
    }
