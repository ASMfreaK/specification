\section{Types}

\subsection{Void types}

Void types are used for padding purposes.
As will be explained in later sections, it is desirable to align fields at byte boundaries;
void types can be used to facilitate that.

Void-typed fields are set to zero when a data structure is serialized and ignored when it is deserialized.
Void types can be used to reserve space in data type definitions for possible use in later versions of the data type.

The DSDL name pattern for void types is as follows: ``\verb|void[1-9]\d?|'',
where the trailing one- or two-digit integer represents the length of the void field, in bits,
ranging from 1 to 64, inclusive.

Void types can be referred to directly by their name from any namespace.

\subsection{Primitive types}

Primitive types are defined here. They are assumed to be known to DSDL processing tools a priori,
and as such, they need not be defined by the user.
Primitive types can be referred to directly by their name from any namespace.

The following text defines DSDL name patterns using the POSIX Extended Regular Expression (ERE) notation.

The hierarchy of primitive types is documented below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Boolean types.} A boolean-typed value represents a variable of the Boolean algebra.
    A Boolean-typed value can have two values: true and false.
    The corresponding DSDL data type name is ``\verb|bool|''.

    \item \textbf{Algebraic types.} Those are types for which conventional algebraic operators are defined.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Integer types} are used to represent signed and unsigned integer values.
        See table \ref{table:dsd_integer_properties}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Signed integer types.} These are used to represent values which can be negative.
            The corresponding DSDL data type name pattern is ``\verb|int[1-9]\d?|'',
            where the trailing one- or two-digit integer represents the length of the
            encoded representation of the value, in bits, ranging from 2 to 64, inclusive.

            \item \textbf{Unsigned integer types.} These are used to represent non-negative values.
            The corresponding DSDL data type name pattern is ``\verb|uint[1-9]\d?|'',
            where the trailing one- or two-digit integer represents the length of the
            encoded representation of the value, in bits, ranging from 2 to 64, inclusive.
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Floating point types} are used to approximately represent real values.
        The underlying encoded representation follows the IEEE 754 standard.
        The corresponding DSDL data type name pattern is ``\verb~float(16|32|64)~'', where the trailing
        integer represents the type of the IEEE 754 representation.
        See table \ref{table:dsd_floating_point_properties}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Array types}

An array type represents an ordered collection of values.
All values in the collection share the same type, which is referred to as \emph{array element type}.
The array element type can be any type except:
\begin{itemize}
    \item void type;
    \item array type\footnote{Meaning that nested arrays are not allowed;
    however, the array element type can be a compound type which in turn may contain arrays.
    In other words, indirect nesting of arrays is permitted.}.
\end{itemize}

The number of elements in the array can be specified as a constant at the data type definition time,
in which case the array is said to be a \emph{fixed-length array}.
Alternatively, the number of elements can vary between zero and some static limit specified
at the data type definition time,
in which case the array is said to be a \emph{variable-length array}.
Variable-length arrays with unbounded maximum number of elements cannot be defined in DSDL.

Arrays are defined by adding a pair of square brackets after the array element type specification,
where the brackets contain the \emph{array capacity expression}\footnote{%
Expressions are reviewed in detail in section \ref{sec:dsdl_expressions}.}.
The array capacity expression must yield a positive integer upon its evaluation;
any other type or a non-positive integer must be treated as a malformed definition.

The array capacity expression can be prefixed with the following character sequences in order to define
a variable-length array:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``\verb|<|'' (ASCII code 60) --- indicates that the integer value yielded by the array capacity expression
    specifies the non-inclusive upper boundary of the number of elements.

    \item ``\verb|<=|'' (ASCII code 60 followed by 61) --- same as above, but the upper boundary is inclusive.
\end{itemize}
If neither of the above prefixes are provided, the resultant definition is that of a fixed-length array.

\subsection{Compound types}

\subsubsection{Kinds}

There are two kinds of compound data type definitions: message types and service types.
All versions of a data type definition must be of the same kind\footnote{%
For example, if a data type version 0.1 is of a message kind, all later versions of it must be messages, too.}.

A message data type definition contains the description of the message data structure without any additional entities.
The data structure description may be empty, i.e. it may define no fields or constants.

A service data type definition contains the description of two data structures:
the service request structure followed by the service response structure.
The two structures are separated by the service response marker (``\verb|---|'') on a separate line.
Either or both of the structures may be empty.

The presence of the service response marker indicates that the data type definition at hand is of the service kind.
There may be no more than one service response marker in a given definition.

\subsubsection{Dependencies}

In order to refer to a compound type from another compound type definition
(e.g., for nesting or for referring to an external constant),
one has to specify the full data type name of the referred data type followed by its
major and minor version numbers separated by the namespace separator character,
as demonstrated on the figure \ref{fig:dsdl_nested_reference}.

To facilitate look-up of external dependencies,
implementations are expected to receive from external sources%
\footnote{For example, from user-provided configuration options.}
the list of directories that are the roots of namespaces containing the referred dependencies.

\begin{figure}[H]
    $$
    \underbrace{\texttt{\huge{uavcan.node.Heartbeat}}}_{\text{Full data type name}}%
    \texttt{\huge{.}}%
    \underbrace{\texttt{\huge{1.0}}}_{\substack{\text{version} \\ \text{numbers}}}%
    $$
    \caption{Reference to an external compound data type definition.\label{fig:dsdl_nested_reference}}
\end{figure}

If the referred data type and the referring data type share the same full namespace name,
it is allowed to omit the namespace from the referred data type specification
leaving only the short data type name, as demonstrated on the figure \ref{fig:dsdl_nested_reference_short}.
In this case, the referred data type will be looked for in the namespace of the referrer.
Partial omission of namespace components is not permitted.

\begin{figure}[H]
    $$
    \underbrace{\texttt{\huge{Heartbeat}}}_{\text{Short data type name}}%
    \texttt{\huge{.}}%
    \underbrace{\texttt{\huge{1.0}}}_{\substack{\text{version} \\ \text{numbers}}}%
    $$
    \caption{Reference to an external compound data type definition located in the same namespace.
    \label{fig:dsdl_nested_reference_short}}
\end{figure}

Circular dependencies are not permitted.
A circular dependency renders all of the definitions involved in the dependency loop invalid.

If any of the referred definitions are marked as deprecated,
the referring definition must be marked deprecated as well\footnote{%
Deprecation is indicated with the help of a special directive, as explained in section \ref{sec:dsdl_directives}}.
If a non-deprecated definition refers to a deprecated definition,
the referring definition is malformed\footnote{%
This poisonous deprecation rule is designed to prevent unexpected breakage of
type hierarchies when one of the deprecated dependencies reaches its end of life.}.

\subsubsection{Unions}

Any data structure definition can be supplied with a special directive indicating that the containing
data structure is a tagged union\footnote{Section \ref{sec:dsdl_directives}.}.

A tagged union must define at least two fields.
The value of a tagged union is a function of the field which value it is currently holding
and the value of the field itself.
