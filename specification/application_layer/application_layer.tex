\chapter{Application layer}\label{sec:application_layer}

Previous chapters of this specification define a set of basic concepts that are the foundation of the protocol:
they allow one to define data types and exchange data objects over the bus in a robust and deterministic manner.
This chapter is focused on higher-level concepts: rules, conventions, and standard functions that are to be
respected by applications utilizing UAVCAN to maximize cross-vendor compatibility, avoid ambiguities, and
prevent some common design pitfalls.

The rules, conventions, and standard functions defined in this chapter are designed to be an acceptable middle
ground for any sensible aerospace or robotic system.
UAVCAN does not attempt to favor any particular domain or kind of systems among targeted applications.

Unless stated otherwise, all of the high-level functions described in this chapter are optional,
meaning that they do not necessarily have to be supported or implemented for an application or system to be
UAVCAN-compliant.
Excepting a very few mandatory functions and rules, users of UAVCAN are allowed to pick only those
that are needed and suitable for their applications.

If a designer choses to deviate from the rules and conventions presented in this chapter,
every such deviation should be explicitly documented.
