\chapter{List of standard data types}\label{sec:sdt}

This chapter contains the full list of standard data types defined by the UAVCAN specification.
The source text of the DSDL data type definitions provided here is also available via the
official project website at \href{http://uavcan.org}{uavcan.org}.

Regulated non-standard definitions\footnote{%
    I.e., public definitions contributed by vendors and other users
    of the specification, as explained in section~\ref{sec:basic_data_type_regulation}.
} are not included in this list.

In the table, \emph{BLS} stands for bit length set.
The extent is not shown for final entities -- that would be redundant because finality implies
that the extent equals the maximum bit length set.
For service types, the parameters pertaining to the request and response schemas are shown separately.

The index table~\ref{table:dsdl:uavcan} is provided before the definitions for ease of navigation.
