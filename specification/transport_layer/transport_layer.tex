\chapter{Transport layer}\label{sec:transport_layer}

This chapter defines the transport layer of UAVCAN.
First, general implementation-agnostic concepts are introduced.
Afterwards, they are further defined for each supported transport medium, e.g., CAN bus.

As the specification is extended to add support for new transport protocols,
some of the generic aspects may be pushed to lower-level transport-specific sections
if they are found to map poorly onto the newly added transports.
Such changes are guaranteed to preserve full backward compatibility of the existing transport protocols.
