\chapter{Physical layer}\label{sec:physical_layer}

This chapter contains the specification of the supported physical layers of UAVCAN,
as well as some related hardware design recommendations.

Following the requirements and recommendations of this chapter will ensure the highest level of
inter-vendor compatibility and allow the developers to avoid many common design pitfalls.

The chapters that provide transport-specific physical layer specification
directly correspond to those defined in the chapter \ref{sec:transport_layer}.

% Please keep \clearpage in front of every transport-specific specification to enforce clear separation!
