\section{Application-level functions}\label{sec:application_level_functions}

This section documents the high-level functionality defined by UAVCAN.
Common high-level functions form a uniform set of basic functions that span across different application domains.
All of the functions defined in this section are optional,
except for the node heartbeat feature (section \ref{sec:application_node_heartbeat}),
which is mandatory for all UAVCAN nodes.

\subsection{Node initialization}

UAVCAN does not require that nodes undergo any specific initialization upon connecting to the bus ---
a node is free to begin functioning immediately once it is powered up.
However, the transitioning to the operating state (even if there is no other state to transition from)
is to be reflected via the mandatory heartbeat message, described in section \ref{sec:application_node_heartbeat}.

\subsection{Node heartbeat}\label{sec:application_node_heartbeat}

Every UAVCAN node must report its status and presence by publishing messages of type
\DSDLReference{uavcan.node.Heartbeat} at a fixed rate specified in the message definition.

This is the only data type that UAVCAN nodes are required to support.
All other data types and application-level functions are optional.
