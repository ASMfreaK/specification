\chapter{Physical layer}\label{sec:physical}

This chapter is dedicated to the physical aspects of UAVCAN:
physical layer, connectivity options, electrical and electromechanical design considerations.
It contains a set of transport-agnostic recommendations followed by transport-specific sections,
one per concrete transport, matching the arrangement of chapter \ref{sec:transport}.

Following the requirements and recommendations of this chapter will ensure the highest level of
inter-vendor compatibility and allow the developers to avoid common design pitfalls.

% Please keep \clearpage in front of every section to enforce clear separation.
