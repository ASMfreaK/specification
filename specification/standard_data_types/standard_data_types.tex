\chapter{List of standard data types}

This chapter contains the full list of standard data types defined by the UAVCAN specification.
The source text of the DSDL data type definitions provided here is also available via the
official project website at \href{http://uavcan.org}{uavcan.org}.

Regulated non-standard definitions\footnote{I.e., public definitions contributed by vendors and other users
of the specification, as explained in section \ref{sec:basic_concepts_data_type_regulation}.}
are intentionally not included in this list, as they are of limited importance for the specification.

Each definition is provided with a length information table for convenience,
where the minimum and maximum serialized length is shown in several units:
bits, bytes (octets), and transport frames for some of the supported transport protocols.
The acronym \emph{MTU} used in the length information tables stands for
\emph{maximum transmission unit}, which is the maximum amount of data, in bytes (octets, eight bits per byte),
that fits into one transport frame for the specific transport protocol.

The index table \ref{table:dsdl:uavcan} is provided before the definitions for ease of navigation.
